# Tele-Churn2-Analysis-using-Python
## Project Description


‚óè	This report analyzes customer churn within the telecom dataset to identify key drivers and recommend actionable strategies for retention. The analysis reveals that contract type, internet service, service subscriptions, and customer tenure are significant factors influencing churn. Specifically, month-to-month contract holders, fiber optic internet users, and those with online security, online backup, and device protection services exhibit higher churn rates. Demographic factors such as gender and the presence of dependents also play a role. To mitigate churn, the company should focus on incentivizing longer-term contracts, addressing fiber optic service concerns, re-evaluating service bundle value, and enhancing early customer engagement.
